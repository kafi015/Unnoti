<h2>Tech: Flutter, Dart, Rest API</h2>
<p>Realtime android application. Here I build the customer side of this app. Customers can register, sign in, create profile, update profile, earn point, sell point, see point history. Also see the notification which is sent by the admin side. Here I used clean code architecture and implemented Rest API.</p>
